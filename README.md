More or less useful scripts.

* text_fitter.py - a mini script collapsing a multi-line text into the column with fixed amount of characters per line. It also adds quotation marks at the beginning and the end of each line and escapes specials characters, like \t and \n. It can be useful, when you need to paste a long text as a string into a Python script, and want it to look esthetically.
